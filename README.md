# Task

<p>We will create a classic "rock paper scissors" game, and we will be playing the game against the computer..."<p>






### Understand the Problem - 

<p>We're trying to create a program that would allow us to make a rock-paper-scissors game against the computer...<p>







### Plan -
 
<p>We know that our program will not have a user interface since we're just playing against the computer we could run this game within the console.<p>

<p>The main input for this program will be us, the client and we will be inputting between the three choices of "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".<p>

<p>The desired output of this program would be either a win or lose depending on what the computer has chosen: Both the client choice and the user choice should be displayed in the console and depending on the "rules" of the game one would be victorious.<p>


##### Step 1.

<p>We would first need to create a prompt that would ask for either a "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" input.<p>

##### Step 2.

<p>After that input is inputted the computer would then generate a random guess between those three values.<p>

##### Step 3. 

<p>Both guesses will be displayed in the console and depending on the "rules" of the game a third string will be displayed which is either a win or lose.<p>





### Pseudocode

###### Line 1 : A way to get the user to input a specific value of either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"

###### Line 2: Return this value as a string and print it in the console...

###### Line 3: Randomly generate either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" and display in the console right after the user input is displayed...

###### Line 4: Display a win depending on "rules" of game
